# Updates

## Update: 21 NOV 2024

**Enhanced Functionality for Public Channels:**

1. Removed the unnecessary login requirement for processing links from public channels.  
2. Users can now process both single and batch links from public channels, even without logging in or setting up a default session.  
3. Introduced batch size limit variables: `FREEMIUM_LIMIT` and `PREMIUM_LIMIT`. These variables allow you to manage and customize the batch size accessible to users based on their subscription type.

**👉 Note:**  
If you set the `FREEMIUM_LIMIT` value to 0, users will not be able to extract links, even with a single link. The `OWNER_ID(s)` are exempt from these limitations.

suppose main post link is
`https://t.me/username/12` or `https://t.me/username/6/12 (topic enabled group)
` then you have to change like below
`https://t.me/c/1346789/12` or `https://t.me/c/1346789/6/12 (topic enabled group)`
where `1346789` is group id you get from telegram client apps like `turbotel, plus messenger` etc

## Important Note

**Note**: Changing the terms and commands doesn't magically make you a developer. Real development involves understanding the code, writing new functionalities, and debugging issues, not just renaming things. If only it were that easy!
